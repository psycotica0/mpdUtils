These are a collection of various apps I wrote to ease some of the tasks I do with mpd.

They are:
lastSong - This app runs until the song changes, then pauses. Meaning "This is the last song", or "Stop after this one"
mpdCurrentSong - This is mostly a helper script that just returns the current place in the playlist for other scripts.
mpdDJ - This maintains the playlist under certain criteria, it is documented in README.mpdDJ
playNext - This takes in on stdin an input suitable for "mpc add" and makes that song next in the playlist
playNow - This is basically just playNext, then it plays it. It's used for playing a give song now instead of the current one.
